            <p>I enjoy making music and geeking out on all sorts of stuff: Rubik's Cubes, hacking, astronomy, trees, physics. I live with some very smart, pretty, and funny ladies that seem to like me, too, which is nice.</p>
            <p>I grew up in a very small town in the country, the son of a nerd, and very early became transfixed by all things electronic and digital. I tinkered with everything I could and never stopped.</p>
            <p>As a 2M071 in the USAF I worked on many fantastic pieces of electronics. One of my favorites was the Electronic Systems Test Set. That was a room full of 1970's racks with the switches and flashing lights my generation has mostly not seen in person. The disks were 14 inches in diameter and initialized by manually switching octal into a few registers.</p>
            <p>I have strived very hard both personally and professionally to keep up to date with software since I started. Currently, I am spending a lot of time with Python, Fabric, Salt-stack, and continuous integration. I love Python, Git, and Vim. In my most recent position, I worked to implement automation routines that used Fabric, Saltstack, Openstack, and Foreman to simplify the creation and management of servers. This is some of the most interesting work I have done.</p>
            <p>I my previous profession, I had the opportunity to address a lot of skill-sets from Incident Command System and National Incident Management System, to web development and software development and connecting to RESTful services. It was great, but I really wanted to devote my time to development.</p>
            <p>I have found a wonderful field in DevOps, and I really hope to continue working in this profession.</p>
