            <p>I strive to be good, humble, honest, sincere, and reliable. My work ethic is based on this and desire for simplicity and elegance. I enjoy making music and geeking out on all sorts of stuff: Rubik's Cubes, hacking, astronomy, trees, physics. I live with some very smart, pretty, and funny ladies that seem to like me, too, which is nice.</p>
            <p>I grew up in a very small town in the country, the son of a nerd, and very early became transfixed by all things electronic and digital. I tinkered with everything I could and never stopped.</p>
            <p>As a 2M071 in the USAF I worked on many fantastic pieces of electronics. One of my favorites was the Electronic Systems Test Set. That was a room full of 1970's racks with the switches and flashing lights my generation has mostly not seen in person. The disks were 14 inches in diameter and initialized by manually switching octal into a few registers.</p>
            <p>After the military, I had the opportunity to address a lot of skill-sets from Incident Command System and National Incident Management System to software development and GIS. It was great working with emergency response, but I really wanted to devote my time to programming and get back to what I love most, problem solving.</p>
            <p>It has been by goal to keep my knowledge of integral and current software languages and practices. Most recently, I have spent the bulk of my time writing Go and Python and working a lot with many of the Amazon Web Services tools. I love Go, Python, Linux, Git, Spacemacs, and nearly all things open source. I have worked with many technologies and I enjoy learning more.</p>
            <p>I love programming. It started as a hobby when I was boy copying programs from magazines into a Commodore 64 and later BASIC. There is always learning to be done and interesting problems to be solved, which makes it a wonderful challenge. I like learning modern languages like Go and Rust. Writing any programs that do good or solve challenging problems interest me.</p>
